        "The default model, built with standard hyperparameters, provided a decent baseline but showed limited performance, likely due to underfitting or suboptimal settings. After applying hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, the model’s accuracy and F1-score significantly improved. Tuning parameters like the number of neurons, activation functions, optimizers, and batch sizes allowed the model to learn better patterns and generalize more effectively. Overall, hyperparameter tuning led to a more robust and accurate classifier, highlighting its importance in optimizing neural network performance.\n",
